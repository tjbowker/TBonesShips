<h1> Wooden model Ships by Tom</h1> 

My interest in model ship building started with my grandfather John Fink. He had an antique replica
of the Santa Maria in his living room which fascinated me. The following is a list of the model ships
I have built. The hulls are solid wood mostly Mahogany. Where the hulls are coppered this is real copper
not paint. In olden days the hulls were coppered to keep off barnacles. There are no plastic parts in these models. Cannons are brass or bronze. Fittings are brass. 
Click on the name of the ship which will link you to photos and further information.
