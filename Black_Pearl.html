<h2><em> Black Pearl pirate ship </em>
</h2>
<p> Black Pearl based on the pirate ship in the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean". The original ship had black sails and hull. This is a true plank on bulkhead construction. This model was built by
laying the keel, adding the framing and then forming and attaching the side planking. This is museum quality.
